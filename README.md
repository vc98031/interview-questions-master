1. ### Where you see yourself in ten years
      I am very much passionate about learning new things throughout my life, after 5-10 years also I want to keep it up this passion with more energy.  I see myself as more knowledgeable, more skilled, more hardworking and at a position in company where the organisation will not want to lose at any cost.

2. ### Experiencing Different Cultures
  Discussing different cultures with people of another country can help give you an idea of how different America is from other places.  Sometimes Americans only think about America and not how other countries do things. Talking to someone of another country gave me more respect for them. You learn how different they live and it makes you appreciate their way of living. I spoke with a person I work with. He grew up in Mexico with his two brothers and his parents. He and his family moved to Ohio when he was fifteen, about eight years ago. He told me the biggest difference in the cultures was that his family lived a lower class life in Mexico. His parents had jobs, but they did not make enough to have a great life.

3. ### Who is your role model or Motivator and why
   I am inspired not by one but by many persons. By Teresa for her Kindness, by NR Naryan Murthy sir for his dynamic lead, by Vivekananda for his confidence and by all those who are currently working in MNC’s like yours’ because of their contribution to the company as well as the country.

4. ### The best time of the year
   Although many people believe that the college years are the best time in a person’s life, my opinion is different. I suppose that the first years after a graduation from a university, when a person starts working and becomes independent, are really the best time in a life.  And I have several reasons in support of my thinking. In the first place, the feeling of being independent is wonderful! After 20 years under a parental control, a person can finally start taking decisions and acting according to his or her own desires. Such a person can decide where to go for a holiday, which films to watch and how to dress. Frankly, this freedom has a great value for me. My second reason is that this time is perfect for falling in love and getting married.  By the age of 25 people usually become mentally and emotionally mature, which allows them to build families and have children. And, personally, the values of having a family and children have always been extremely important for me.

5. ### My Favorite Day of the Week
   No doubt the most popular answer to this question: Saturday. I wake up after a restful night of sleep and start to work on bringing this wonderful community to life, byte by byte. I enjoy delicious coffee and talk to people whom I value greatly, then return to be with my wife. We usually run errands or go enjoy some serene piece of Austin before the evening settles in. Saturday evening is a time of near infinite possibility and ecstatic vivacity: there is nothing forcing us to wake up early, friends and events are available and numerous, and some of the best mellow nightlife in our city is alive, patient and inviting. No time limits no boundaries, no worries; just relaxed life. I love Saturdays.

7. ### What country do you think is the best to live ?
   I love England; its political systems may have flaws but are still much better than those of its closest rivals such as America or other European countries, we also have the world’s strongest currency, free healthcare and other benefits of the wealth fare state to help those in unfortunate situations. if i had to pick a place other than England i would have to say Amsterdam (i know it’s a town but still), it’s quite an odd place but very surreal, and is still a very westernized country so the change wouldn’t be too much from back home

8. ### What is really the best to live Village or City ?
    ya it is that village life is better than city life because… The cost of living is very high in the city. Most goods are very expensive. There is no fresh air and pure water.  The environment is polluted with dust, smoke, garbage and dioxide gases from factories. Most of the people who live in the city are corrupted. So there are lots of crimes in the city. Many thefts and murders often take place in the city. The city is always busy and noisy. There are a lot of vehicles and people in the road. The streets are dusty and unclean. So it is hard to lead a healthy life in the city. As well as there are so many advantages in the village life. Mainly the people of the village live in unity and peace. The villagers earn money very hard and earn money enough for live. So they live less competition with each other. So they can reach a good position. They have more friends in the community since it is small. The village people always try to protect their traditional habits and culture. The village has clean air and the environment is very beautiful. The village has less noise and rush. So the pollution is less. The village has not lot of vehicles. So roads are less dangerous for driving cycle. They can get fresh vegetables and fresh fruits. The environment of the village is pleasant and silent and it has scenic beauty. The city is full of chemical, if you want to eat sweet you have to eat many chemical present in sweet like chocolates but in village sweets are made up of pure ghee and milk.

With all these new computers and technology there are more people not keeping fit because of such addictions in front of a computer? All in all, there are a lot of things that we favor with computers. such as; Online profiles (MySpace, Facebook, bebop..etc.),  Online Shopping (Ebay, online shops), Forums and online communities, E-mail and instant messaging… and so much more. The computers and internet has brought the world to talk to each other bring people around the world closer no matter where they are. The internet brings knowledge and you can learn many things from it with the information it can provide. The internet is extremely powerful but with this power needs to be responsibility again, as people use the internet as a weapon like hacking and viruses. People have shut down certain sites to prove that they can do such things as a threat. There is information on the internet which help people successfully commit crimes on the streets without being caught. In conclusion, computers and the new technology is good for the world. But i also think that it at least to be controlled more. To make it limited in some way with certain information

12. ### Advantages and disadvantages of mobile phones
       One of the instant forms of business communication is email. But email has several downfalls to go along with its benefits that make it a challenging way to send information. Before you get involved in an email conversation with a business associate, you should spend some time understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using email as a business communications tool. Speed – When you need to get an important message to a client or business associate who is located thousands of miles away, one of the fastest ways to do it is by email. The advantage email has over the telephone in communication speed is that you can send attachments with an email that contain important documents or even a presentation to clarify your message. Availablity – Thousands of email messages can be archived into folders on your computer or handheld communication device such as a cell phone to be retrieved when you need them. The convenience of email prevents you from having to keep file folders filled with papers and it makes your important correspondence portable. Cost-Effective – Aside from the cost of your Internet connection, email is free. You can send as many messages, files, videos, documents and presentations as you want without having to pay anything. It significantly reduces your company’s shipping and postage costs. Vulnerability – It would take a manual effort on the part of someone to access all of your important printed documents and destroy them. But all of your emails and important information can be lost with a simple hard-drive crash. If you store your email information on another server, then you could lose your data if that site goes down or out of business. Accessibility – When someone hands you a business letter, you are the only person that receives that letter. An email can be intercepted by a hacker or go to an incorrect email address and wind up in someone else’s inbox. Your sensitive information and messages are very accessible to hackers and even unsuspecting recipients when you use email. Emotionless – A disadvantage of email is that people tend to treat it like a conversation because email can happen so quickly and they begin to use slang terms and try to carry on conversations via email. Because email recipients cannot see each other, the emails do not have any voice inflection or emotion that can help with proper interpretation.

      Mobile phones have altered our way of life to an unbelievable degree.

Individuals stay hectic using their tissue even when sitting in a team of other people. There are many tales about the people who fulfilled accidents because of to keeping focus on their own mobile phone while driving. Therefore, this is one of the greatest disadvantages of these types of devices. Mobile mobile phones are used by criminals to inform one another about their filthy ideas.

15. ### Which city is your favourite and why?
       I like Pune , mostly because I lived their as a child and it will always be home to me. But really, I enjoy that it’s like a city that always stands on the cutting edge of the latest trends in both style and technology.  and Lonavla ,khandala – which are available with only a few hours drive that you’re always close to nature. There’s plenty of things to do if you like outdoors and mild city life. Lastly, what makes Pune a great place to live is that the area provides the best amenities of big-city life with access to wonderful opportunities in education and career choices for it’s residents. And for all that,Pune is the best city to live. And of course, the weather. Not every other city have a great weather .
